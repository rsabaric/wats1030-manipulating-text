I liked using the Nano editor best as I felt like the commands seemed a little bit more intituvie. Although I did enjoy Vi, some of the commands were a little bit odd and took me awhile to get through some of the prompts. I had to think a lot more about what I was doing. I wanted to enjoy emacs more, but I kept getting bumped out of the server frequently. I felt like I had to work quickly with that editor. I did get bumbed out of the other editors as well, but with emacs it was a lot. I liked using the Nano best as I felt like the commands seemed to make sense more.
